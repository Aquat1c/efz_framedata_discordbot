Otherwise follows the same rules as A and B versions, any version of this move will make all the fireworks currently on the ground explode. Use this version to gain control over the ground.

Knocks down when it hits raw or after a couple of hits, but is techable if used as a combo finisher. These shortcomings make it a somewhat lackluster move, but the fast startup and decent horizontal reach might surprise an opponent expecting f5B or 5C. Can't airdash forward after ICing this move without performing an airjump first.",

This move is perhaps one of the best anti-airs in the game thanks to its fast startup, high vertical reach and very generous invulnerability. Almost always safe when blocked by an airborne opponent, and you'll usually have time to even repeat it should they try to dash back in. Recovers before the opponent can airtech on a raw hit, decent combo options with IC. Because it's Makoto's only proper anti-air, learning to use this move effectively is mandatory if you wish to play her.",

The second hit launches the opponent forward with wallbounce properties. A mashy opponent might try to punish the first kick too early and get caught by the second. If the opponent is close to the corner, this move can be followed up and leads into the usual corner loops, otherwise can be followed up with 412C if you have enough RF meter, 66 J9 J9 into air normals with a very tight timing (works as a tech trap too), or just tech trap with 412A (avoidable, but the bullet will bounce back making it hard for the opponent to act).

Any version of this trap already on the screen will be destroyed immediately when the move is performed again. The damage this trap does by itself is minuscule, but it's very efficient at forcing the opponent to keep blocking. This version rolls forward after being dropped and repeats a cycle of generating 6 puffs of smoke up to 3 times with gaps in between runs, then finally disappears into 4 more puffs. Can be FIC'd the moment Makoto lets go of the bomb, making it a very good option for midscreen oki when you don't have time for anything else. Can be destroyed by the opponent or other projectiles, so make sure to cover it with a meaty 2B or something similar. The gaps between cycles will give you a chance to throw the opponent, or if they're expecting that, punishing their mash or jump out attempts with other moves. Be careful, as the hitstun for the smoke is so short it can mess up your combo links (2B-> smoke-> 2C will often drop for example).",
            "Similar to the A version, but this one will not roll forward, and will simply let out 17 puffs of smoke before disappearing. This is the foundation of your corner oki, giving you time to set up other stuff such as bullets or fireballs, or some high/low mixups. Right after the smoke finishes is a good chance to go for a throw as well, especially if you have a bullet set up that'll punish the opponent's mash. This version has weird hit-eating properties which will protect Makoto from getting hit by the same attack that destroys the bomb. Especially amusing against moves like Sayuri's 41236C wallslam. Like the A version, can be FIC'd to skip the recovery.",
            "This is a direct improvement over the A version. The smoke bomb becomes active faster, and now performs 6 cycles of 8 puffs of smoke, after which it disappears into 4 more puffs for a total of 52. It also has the hit-eating properties of the B version. Despite these improvements, it's the least useful version of this move, as it's still just as fragile, and you usually won't have the meter for FIC to keep the opponent from destroying it."

            "Makoto conjures a huge fireball in front of her, which stays on screen for a long time. Will disappear after 5 hits or blocks, or until it times out (amount of hits doesn't affect the timer). This version slowly rises up above any character's standing height, then descends to the floor and disappears, all the while moving very slowly forward. Very useful as corner oki if you can get the opponent to block this, for example while they're already blocking a smoke trap. The gap when the fireball is at its apex height is a good opportunity to go for a throw, as it'll automatically punish most mash attempts while coming back down, and jumping out will leave the opponent blocking in the air.",
            "Similar to the A version, but doesn't move much besides slowly floating in place. Technically lasts much longer, but is hard to make much use of, because it gets quickly canceled out by blocking when placed on top of the opponent. Can be used as oki against some characters after a 641236A corner knockdown (2AABBC 641236A -> J7 -> 236236B) to make it impossible to act without getting hit by the fireball, forcing them to choose between a throw and fireball damage, but whether this works is highly character dependent.",
            "Like the A version, but also moves forward at a reasonable speed. The shortest lasting variant. Could be used midscreen the same way A version is used in corner, but not as good. Also works as a projectile cover for your approach in neutral if you don't mind spending a super bar."

Makoto's primary source of damage, it can always be used after 2C as a combo finisher and corner carry, and can be IC'd for even more damage. This version has the fastest startup but no invulnerability whatsoever, so its only use is in combos. Can drop early when done at max distance. Extremely unsafe on block, but when IC'd in the air early into the move, gives enough time to deliver one j5A/j5B for a quick mixup. The fire effect has a leftover hurtbox on all versions of this move with similar hit-eating properties as 214B/C, that lasts for 2 frames in the middle of the move, if you're very lucky it's possible for the opponent to hit this instead of you when going for a reversal.",
            "An improved version that has invulnerability all the way to the 2nd active frame, making it a very good reversal. Moves faster and travels further than A version, which makes it less likely from the opponent to drop out of this, but the damage/cost ratio isn't as good. Use in combos when you think A would drop. The long travel distance and relatively short total duration can make it hard for the opponent to punish this if they jump over it, but when blocked it's just as unsafe as A. Be wary of the slightly longer startup.",
            "Because of the long startup, this version is usually not suitable for combos outside of corner, and although it's invulnerable all the way until landing, it might be too slow to be used as a reversal in some situations. Nevertheless, it has some uses, especially since it allows you to travel from one side of the screen to the another while fully invulnerable. Unlike the other versions, this move can become inactive before landing if it hits/gets blocked right from the start (up to 19 hits), making the effective recovery duration much longer for you."

            "Makoto throws a meat bun into the air and attempts to catch it in her mouth. If she eats it, she regains health. The throw part is one of the extremely rare real unblockables in the game, making it possible to use eg. smoke trap setups for a guaranteed heal. If it hits it's a guaranteed knockdown (it even has armor breaking properties), otherwise the opponent has the opportunity to hit the meat bun before it reaches Makoto to prevent health regeneration. Makoto herself is completely invulnerable throughout this move and has throw protection for a while after it, so the only damage you'll suffer is the mental damage from having your snack taken from you. The recovery duration depends on whether or not Makoto gets to eat the bun, and how late the opponent hit it to prevent the heal. Although the move does 0 damage by itself, it's possible to use the unblockable together with smoke if you've chipped the opponent down to 1HP and only need to deal the winning blow. It's also possible to do some gimmicky smoke/bullet setups to combo the meat bun into bullet for about 300 damage: 662C -> small delay -> 214B FIC 5C 412B 66 263S (not tight until the opponent starts blocking the smoke, but they're probably not expecting this). Note: Be careful while inputting this move; while super inputs are usually prioritized over specials, this move seems to be outprioritized by valid inputs that don't have moves associated with them, such as 236S and 623S. These are easy to input by accident, for example, if you're doing this move from a dash, you're probably holding 6 already and inputting this move as 6263S, which will count as 623S first. This can cause your super to be delayed until the offending input has fallen out of the input buffer (236 has a 15 frame input window, while 623 has 20), or not come out at all (2623S will not work for example, as 263S also has a 20 frame buffer, so the initial 2 will always fall out before 623)."
