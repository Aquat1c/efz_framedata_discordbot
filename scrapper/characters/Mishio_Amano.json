            "Mishio powers up with a nine-tailed shockwave, hitting anyone closeby. She then enters the Awakened state, which gives her unlimited access to both elements, for an entire 15 seconds. This move can be whiff cancelled from most normals, but inputting the command may be a bit tricky, since it won't work if done too quickly. An alternative input would be BB25CA, where the 5 signifies a slight pause in your input. The move is completely invulnerable for all but the last few frames, which can be very surprising if you have blocked its single hit and then try to punish. Also of note is that Mishio has no collision whatsoever during the FM animation, so you might be able to create some entertaining setups on her."
