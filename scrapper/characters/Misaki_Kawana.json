Though it has its occasional use in normal ground strings, most of its combo use is either to relaunch during an air combo with 5C in the corner, or to relaunch midscreen by itself. Its range makes it fairly difficult to combo into without a Blue IC, so your timing with it will be tight. Using it as an anti-air combo starter is also somewhat risky because of the range, but it cannot be air blocked, so if somebody tries an empty jump or does something stupid, this will net you a free 3000+ damage. Be careful with this move, though, because there is gap between the distances where c.B and f.B will activate, where both of them will miss."

It has a slow startup and the Guard Point doesn't start frame 1. It can be airblocked unlike most of Misaki's grounded normals. And even though it looks like the hitbox lingers excessively, it's incredibly unsafe on block (it can only be jump cancelled on hit as well). This move has its use mainly in corner loops and combos, but it can still be a strong anti air if you know the opponent is going to go for a jump in.

Don't throw this out wildly, though. It's unsafe on block, is slow to start, and cannot be jump cancelled under any circumstances.

You will use this move a lot, as it's probably her best jumping normal, which really says something. If you use this on Oki, you can airdash over an opponent as they get up and use it as a crossup attempt, since its hitbox is so wide.

            "Misaki will go a set distance before performing an animation similar to her j.B, complete with the same wonderful width in its hitbox. It can lead into a combo, and is safe on block (~+5), and on oki, it works very well as a crossup due to the delay. Even though this move can't be reliably comboed into, and its cross up option is worthless in the corner, what makes this move great is both its ability to be comboed out of extremely easily, and the tick throw and pressure setups you get when it's blocked.",
            "What makes the standing B version great is combo-ability, its startup, its active window, and its minor invincibility. This move combos from Misaki's sweep and most of her normals, so it's decent damage although you'll sacrifice knockdown without meter. If you IC it, you can get massive damage with or without meter. If you land it late, you can link it into 2A or 5A on landing. Next, it is tied for the fastest grounded version of this move with 214C. Following, its hitbox stays out for a good amount of time. And lastly, it has great lower body invincibility, so it'll plow through poorly executed lows.",
            "This is one of your best reversal options period. Decent startup, knockdown on hit, and great invincibility, this move will plow through absolutely anything your opponent attempts to pressure you with on oki, rushdown or otherwise. Furthermore, it's active for nearly half a second, goes airborne, and the followup will definitely turn the tables for you. But as with all reasonable reversals, this move is also incredibly unsafe on block, so don't get predictable, especially if your RF meter has just gone red. If your RF meter is light blue, you can IC it to make it safe or lead to followups, though that's a hit or miss because even though the prorate on this move is extremely light, burning that much meter to make it safe might not be worth the attempt. Second hit only comes out if the first hit connects, hit or block.",
            "The same animation as her standing A version, except this time Misaki's swipe is an overhead that causes knockdown. It will still cross up the same as the standing A version along with a better startup speed and active window, but because of the knockdown, it won't lead to much of anything. As the only off the ground overhead in your arsenal, you'll need to mix this in with the other versions due to its startup. Relying solely on it will become extremely predictable and unsafe.",
            "Looks and acts nearly the same as the Standing B Version, but with one major difference and a few minor ones. It's good if you've comboed the opponent into the corner and want to Blue IC into Misaki's Down Burst loop. Tiger Kneeing this move on an opponent waking up midscreen can lead to a crossup hit, and can be ICed for a full combo. However, it can whiff on small crouchers, so you'll need to rely on forcing them to block high with the Aerial A Overhead Version. Used in conjunction with other versions of this move, this will quickly scare opponents into wondering exactly how they need to block or even try to execute a reversal.",
            "Used best as a combo ender if you didn't IC to start the combo, or managed to keep it going long enough to build up enough meter to get it back to red before the combo ended. This move lacks the invincibility of its ground counterpart, but starts immediately, so no matter how little hitstun the opponent has left, you're pretty much guaranteed your last punch of damage and knockdown if you cancel your last normal into this."
