              "notes": "Mini Mai will fire multiple slow moving single hit fireballs. The higher the level the more she fires. Each fireball's vertical position is random, making it somewhat unreliable in combos. But there are a few stable combos using version A or B (especially A). Great way to lock the opponent down in the corner (especially at level 3), or to force an advantageous situation in neutral. Blocking all fireballs will crank the Guard Gauge and allow Mai to combo off of her lightning fast tk623C. Mini Mai is invincible during the move in all versions. Mini Mai will disappear once the move is done, has a long charge recovery."
