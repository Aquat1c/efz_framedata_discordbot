Afterwards, Ikumi enters Genocide Mode, glowing golden and leaving afterimages until the GENOCIDE gauge is depleted. The gauge will drain naturally in 420 frames and will even deplete during superflash and hitstop but collecting blood will add slightly more time. While Ikumi is in this frenzied state: Ikumi has constant recoil armor which lets her skip neutral (but also prevents her from blocking or RGing). Using special moves will not drain the gauge. Many moves have altered frame data, usually in the form of less recovery. Some new combo routes are made possible. 66B launches the opponent. 66C is special cancellable. 662C is jump cancellable on block and can be comboed after midscreen. All versions of Bloodstained Cross can be comboed after. Feast's Omen is boosted to 750 base damage and scales less in combos. All versions of Separation have significantly higher damage. Invasion of Blood is changed to explode as soon as Ikumi plunges her hand into the ground, with no need for reactivation. Mirror of Lies becomes inaccessible. Sword of Friendship becomes inaccessible. Rampage becomes inaccessible. When Genocide Mode is over, Ikumi's blood gauge will be empty. This move is a double-edged sword. The benefits are great but the install is too short for Ikumi to justify going back to her weak 0 blood self in most cases. Losing the ability to block also makes installing riskier if Ikumi is at low health or her opponent has strong armor breaking moves. Thankfully, unwanted activations after a combo can be avoided by buffering a special move to use up some blood before Ikumi returns to neutral.",

This step does not damage the opponent in any way. The next time this move is performed, regardless of the button used, Ikumi raises two fingers upwards, and a geyser of blood will spray up directly underneath the opponent. Damage and size of the geyser increase with button strength. This move can be useful for whiff punishing from full screen and is worth considering if you're sitting on full SP in neutral as you can continue to build meter while it is planted. Something to keep in mind is that while this move is technically air unblockable, it's extremely easy to air RG thanks to the superflash. Has a small amount of invincibility when planting and enough to be a (bad) reversal when detonating. Do not let the inactive hitboxes (made of dashed lines) in the B and C pictures fool you. Only the solid red box can hit the opponent. ※ Time at which the explosion's location is set, meaning the opponent only has 3.66 frames to dodge it.",
