The first hit does no damage and can be blocked but on hit or block the game freezes and Kaori throws out the second unblockable hit. Unfortunately for Kaori, the startup is very long and the active frames are very short, making this difficult to hit the opponent with. Even worse, the superflash right before the first hit makes it trivially easy to react to with an invincible move. If the opponent makes a mistake and RG's the first hit, they still get the chance to reversal through the unblockable (although Kaori will be able to counter RG). Even though Kaori jumps during this move, it will most likely whiff on airborne opponents because the hitbox is so low and so small.",
