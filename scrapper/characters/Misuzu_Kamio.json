            "Misuzu does a forward somersault leap at the opponent, her wings extending to hit the space in front of her. It starts up quickly but has loads of recovery time if blocked. This move will launch the opponent a medium distance horizontally if it hits. Its main use is to add damage to combos, usually after a C attack. It's not too good on its own because of the recovery time if the opponent blocks it. When comboing into this move on an enemy in juggle state, particularly from 2C, it is best to delay the cancel into 623A to ensure the knockdown occurs before the juggle meter depletes. If done too early, the opponent may have a chance to air tech without an opportunity for Misuzu to punish.",
            "Same as the A version, except that it starts up late and has no disadvantage on block. This move has too much startup time to be chained into. It is more useful to use as part of a blockstring.",
            "Same as the A version, except that it has invincibility for the most of the startup frames, and if the launched opponent hits the corner before hitting the ground, they will wallbounce. The added wallbounce property makes this move a lot more useful than the A version, since it can lead to longer combos. Normally, the opponent will only be wallbounced by this move if they are already close to the corner, since they are only thrown half a screen away. However there is a way to force a wallbounce from any location as long as you yourself are not against a corner. By performing an IC right after you hit this move and jumping backwards or air backdashing, the screen will stay where it is to keep both players on screen, and the opponent will hit the edge and wallbounce. After that you can airdash forward and continue the combo.",

If Misuzu is attacked by a physical move during her pose, she will vanish behind an unblockable explosion of juice, and reappear from the ground afterwards. The A, B, and C versions will apply 1, 3, and 5 levels of curse respectively, and completely refresh the curse gauge if the opponent was already cursed. Misuzu will open one eye once she's entered recovery. This move has a lot of seemingly unintentional things holding it back. The superflash gives away the intent to counter, so this move will only work on opponents who have already committed to an attack of some sort. Additionally, Misuzu's hurtbox is significantly smaller than it normally is while she's standing, during the one move where she wants to get hit. Once triggered, the hitbox is also much smaller than you would expect, and some characters can IC to retract their hurtbox on a poke. If they triggered it with an invincible move, they will most likely also not get hit as the counter's hitbox is only active for a single frame. Even on a successful hit, the damage is very low unless you maximize the curse damage, which is not guaranteed. Thankfully, Misuzu is fully invincible after the hit, so she can't be punished if it whiffs. Cursing an already cursed opponent will refresh the curse's duration and raise their invisible \"curse level\". Curse damage ignores damage scaling, defense modifiers, and invulnerability but it cannot kill the opponent.

Yukito does this independently for 2 seconds, leaving Misuzu free to get close again and restart a combo. This does minimal damage by itself, but is mainly used either to extend combos, to keep the opponent in block stun for a free mixup, or to regain the initiative by using this right after RGing an opponent's attack. B version - Potato Kick (芋シュート) Misuzu summons Yukito, who kicks Potato in a straight line horizontally across the screen. Potato will drill through opponents, acting as a multi-hit projectile. This move is the best damage dealer for Misuzu for the amount of SP needed. It's almost useless when used outside of combos, though. C version - Uppercut (アッパー) Misuzu summons Yukito, who immediately does a rising uppercut. It's quite cumbersome to combo into this, so this move is mostly used as a low-risk wakeup or anti-air attack."

            "Misuzu concentrates for half a second with sparks gathering around, and then stops time while reappearing in some pajamas. She takes three steps towards the frozen opponent, and if the opponent is on the ground within arms-length of Misuzu on the third step, she will grab them and say \"Goal...\". It is essentially a ground throw with a medium range and a long startup time. It is medium-range only, and can actually whiff if the opponent is too close. She is completely invincible for the entire startup, so the opponent cannot hit you out of it. The most interesting thing is how this move is one of the very few moves in EFZ that ignores all damage scaling. If landed, it will deal 5000 damage precisely, no questions asked, making it the only move capable of killing the opponent who is at 1/2 health single-handedly. If Misuzu manages to win the match with this move, she adds on \"Let happy memories reside at the end...\" (最後にはどうか幸せな記憶を…) with some added music. However, if the throw fails, Misuzu will fall to the ground in a knockdown state, completely vulnerable to attack for two seconds. The sheer power of this move makes it a move to be feared by the opponent, but it is quite easy to see and evade if the opponent is actively looking for it, since all they need to do is jump when they see the tell-tale sparks. However, since it only takes a half-second to activate and cannot be interrupted, the opponent may change their playing style to increase their chances of evasion. They may refrain from attacks with long recovery times, and might even jump more often if they lack confidence in their reaction time. If the opponent is noticably affected by the threat of your FM, you can try to take advantage of their weakness. Misuzu can whiff cancel most of her normals into this move.",
