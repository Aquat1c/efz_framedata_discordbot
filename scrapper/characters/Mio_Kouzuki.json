Letting go of 2 before pressing the first A however would be invalid. Mio can whiff cancel most of her normals into this move. Knocks down both Mio and her opponent, usually leaving her at frame disadvantage due to her slow wakeup speed. While Mio does not take damage, if she has BIC she will lose about 15% of it. Can be comboed into. Lucky Mio! MUCH faster than LR Mio's other \"reversal\" options and doesn't struggle at point blank like her 412C, but extremely dangerous to use due to the cost and FM health requirement. Extremely easy to counter RG thanks to the superflash. Only use as a last resort!",
