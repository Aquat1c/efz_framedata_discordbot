After the explosion, Nayuki is blown away from the wall at a very high speed and angle. This move does a crazy high amount of damage when it is comboed into, and does more the farther away Nayuki is from the wall. Nayuki can airdash forward and continue a combo after the explosion. A strong reversal as despite the long recovery, this move is almost unpunishable on block due to the combination of the fullscreen pushback and Nayuki's ability to cancel her recovery very early (frame 19 of recovery) with FIC or an airdash to make pinning her down difficult. Even on whiff, the space that Nayuki flies through during recovery is difficult for the opponent to cover after dodging the attack, and even if they do it's another challenge to turn that punish into a combo. As you may expect from the input, this move can be whiff cancelled into from most normals."
