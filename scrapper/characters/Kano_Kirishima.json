As soon as you let go, three massive lightning strikes come down around the seal, covering almost the whole screen. Kano recovers and can act while the seal is advancing on screen. Useful to force the opponent to either move or allow you in. Either way they will have to deal with your strong normals and the threat of the thunder release. Should they try to avoid it by jumping, you can dash under them for a mixup, as you get to choose when to release the thunder. Or just get in their face, block and release the thunder at the same time."
