            "Mayu launches herself into the the air in a ball. Can be cancelled into Slash Down Kick on whiff or hit. Used in a few combos, but mostly used in blockstrings and pressure. It can crossup quite easily and can be used to start a high/low mixup with IC. ICing immediately after it is blocked allows the player to either immediately drop and go for a low (which is a safejump), or go for an aerial attack. The same applies for Roll Roll Hop.",
            "Mayu launches herself quickly across the screen in a ball. On hit, the opponent will be sent flying back a good distance, and will wallbounce if they reach the wall before hitting the floor. On block, Mayu will slowly bounce back from the impact and land 1/3 of a screen away. This move is great for punishing the opponent when they are vulnerable. Because this version acts so quickly, the opponent will have little time to act if they were in the process of dashing towards you or setting up some trap or special. Also, the additional wallbounce property gives you a chance to deal extra damage for their mistake.",
            "Linked from Roll Roll Roll A or B version. If done from 236B, Mayu must land before 236A can be input. Mayu will perform a jumping multi-hit uppercut towards the opponent. On hit, it will launch the opponent into the air. This is not a great move to rely on. If the opponent has blocked the initial approach attack, then they will almost certainly block the Ferret Uppercut follow-up if you use it, which will lead to a painful counterattack during your lengthy recovery. If you manage to hit with the Roll Roll Roll move, say in the middle of a combo, the Roll Roll Hop follow-up is still better at dealing more damage, and at keeping the opponent within reach in case they try to air-tech. The real value of 236A~A is when your opponent RGs your Roll Roll Roll: this uppercut has fully invulnerable startup, allowing you to beat all sorts of retaliation attempts! ※236B~[land]236A is NOT invulnerable.",

This move is your IC point for various combos, as it is the perfect height to go into her air loop. Same as Roll Roll Roll B, this move can be used in blockstrings and as a mixup starter. It is, however, with greater risk as the opponent has a chance to RG Roll Roll Roll version A and punish you.",

In the corner, you can almost always get it to connect depending on proration, elsewhere it can be spacing and timing dependent."

You can link it from a blocked 6B to continue your blockstring pressure without losing too much initiative. You can use it as a crossup move where at just the right height you can hit the opponent from the front and still land behind them, causing any attempt at RG-counter attacks to attack the wrong direction. Finally, you can use it as a wall combo ender or air-recovery punisher, so that the opponent is forced to fall down in the corner where you can continue your pressure.",
            "Mayu immediately drops down at a 45-degree angle towards the opponent, kicking all the way down until she reaches the ground. This will not force the opponent to a down state on hit, however it can be easily linked to a ground combo. This move is used to give Mayu an almost un-punishable approach at the opponent, as on block Mayu still has the initiative. However, if RG'd it will become a one hit move and can be very easily punished. Fully invulnerable from frames 1-15, but it is NOT invulnerable on first active frame! Still, it gives you a terrific option for beating opponent reversals or challenging your opponent in the air."

            "This is one of Mayu's most powerful options for discouraging aerial approaches from the opponent. It moves fast, can't be blocked or RG'd in the air, and only a few aerial attacks like Akiko's j.C can reliably stuff it after it is activated. That being said, it is very much a all-or-nothing affair. If the opponent baits it out by moving directly above you, dashing back suddenly, or landing before you expected, then the opponent will be able to punish you quite easily as you fall back to Earth. Invulnerable on frames 1-8, with very fast startup at 4F, making this a strong reversal option. The huge distance it travels very quickly can let you snatch people out of the air, but if the opponent is very far from where it starts they can get away with air dash or other movement."

Having this threat in your arsenal should force opponents to think twice about standing too close to you on wakeup, or relying solely on aerial approaches, which Mayu already has ample ways to counter. Mayu can whiff cancel most of her normals into this move. Extremely strong if you can learn to cover the \"9\" direction during pressure. An example: f5B 2369[6]3S - this allows you to input 2369 during the f5B animation, you then have time to walk forward a bit with [6] before inputting 3S and activating the super. There are all sorts of creative ways to cover the 9. Learning just how much time you have to complete the super input is crucial for making effective use of this super.
