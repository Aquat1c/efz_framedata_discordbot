This version has the fastest startup but no invulnerability whatsoever, so its only use is in combos. Can drop early when done at max distance. Extremely unsafe on block, but when IC'd in the air early into the move, gives enough time to deliver one j5A/j5B for a quick mixup."

            "Makoto throws a meat bun into the air and attempts to catch it in her mouth. If she eats it, she regains health. The throw part is one of the extremely rare real unblockables in the game, making it possible to use eg. smoke trap setups for a guaranteed heal. If it hits it's a guaranteed knockdown (it even has armor breaking properties), otherwise the opponent has the opportunity to hit the meat bun before it reaches Makoto to prevent health regeneration.",
            "Makoto herself is completely invulnerable throughout this move and has throw protection for a while after it, so the only damage you'll suffer is the mental damage from having your snack taken from you. The recovery duration depends on whether or not Makoto gets to eat the bun, and how late the opponent hit it to prevent the heal.",
            "Although the move does 0 damage by itself, it's possible to use the unblockable together with smoke if you've chipped the opponent down to 1HP and only need to deal the winning blow. It's also possible to do some gimmicky smoke/bullet setups to combo the meat bun into bullet for about 300 damage: 662C -> small delay -> 214B FIC 5C 412B 66 263S (not tight until the opponent starts blocking the smoke, but they're probably not expecting this).",
            "Note: Be careful while inputting this move; while super inputs are usually prioritized over specials, this move seems to be outprioritized by valid inputs that don't have moves associated with them, such as 236S and 623S. These are easy to input by accident, for example, if you're doing this move from a dash, you're probably holding 6 already and inputting this move as 6263S, which will count as 623S first. This can cause your super to be delayed until the offending input has fallen out of the input buffer."
