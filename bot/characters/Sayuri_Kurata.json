Pushing any attack button during this time will cause her to perform a rising circular kick. It is important to note that this move cannot be buffered, so inputting during blockstop will not work. Sayuri is completely invincible while rising up. How useful this move is depends on what move was caught. For example, quick attacks with short blockstun will be harder to react to with this, while a multihit move may be nigh impossible to get away with. Not to be relied on, but useful as a trump card to keep your opponent on their toes. Player 2 Sayuri has a bug that allows her to perform Magical☆Cutter during the captured move's startup if she is already in blockstun from another move. This makes the move much stronger for Player 2 Sayuri."

This makes it fairly decent for predicting wakeup reversals as it should outlast most other moves' invinciblity. After this period, she has 5 frames of being vulnerable without a hitbox to cover her, which due to how long the invincibility lasts may be difficult to punish before the second hitbox comes out for some characters. The second half is visually identical to A and B but has a much larger hitbox. When used as a crossup from an airdash this move will automatically turn around to face the opponent, making it an excellent mixup tool that has lots of invulnerability frames."

Working this move into your pressure strings and mixups reminds opponents that they can't simply block and react to overheads, they also have to contend with a fast unreactable throw. If we can get the opponent scared they might risk jumping, and we want them to risk jumping. As the input is long, it's important to learn how to hide your inputs during the animations of other moves. One example is point blank 5AA. Buffer 5AA, and during the 5AA animation input the first half circle, walk forward after the last 5A ends and input the last half circle and B. The full input looks like 5AA 63214[6]3214B. Setups like this work best when used sparingly at pressure points where alternative options to catch jumps are used. Lull your opponent into a sense of despair over Sayuri's pressure before attempting. This move's long buffer window allows you to buffer the first half circle, pause and react, then buffer the final half circle. The buffer window also makes it very easy to use as a wake up reversal, by buffering both half circles early, pausing to react to whether your opponent lands low, then pressing the B button if they do. If the opponent does avoid the initial throw, they still have to contend with the lightning that activates regardless of whether the throw connects.",
