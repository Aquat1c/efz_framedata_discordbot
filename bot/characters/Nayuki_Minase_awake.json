The kick itself actually has a good hitbox that is a decent distance away from Nayuki, so it serves as a nice poke that can be convertible from its range as well.

Jump cancelable. Rather quick for a B normal, and does have its usage in pressure to check for lower body invulnerable moves on wake up. Keep in mind: This does not cover every lower-body invuln move e.g. Misaki's 214B. For moves like these, prefer 5C instead. For Recoil Guard battles, this is one of your two 8 frame normals (the other is 5C). If spaced correctly, this can beat some 4F and 5F normals on crouch RG, and will beat anything 6F and onwards.

Nayuki is not considered airborne during this move, so she can special cancel this into anything and will naturally combo into 5C or 2C.

This is the closest to an anti-air normal you will get, but will blow the opponent back too far to convert from midscreen. However, you can convert from this if you are close to the corner. Used in optimal combos frequently. 5C unfortunately cannot be cancelled into 2C, but it can be special or super cancelled. Due to the size of the hitbox, this move can be used to cover both high and low body invulnerability moves on an opponent's wake up option e.g. Misaki 214B, Cello 623A, Mio 623A/B, Doppel 623A/B, ect. However, keep in mind that all of these characters have other reversals or can use Red IC to counter this. On contact and with IC, you can get up to ~4000 damage on a proper conversion. In Recoil Guard battles, this is one Nayuki's two 8 frame moves. If spaced correctly, this can beat up a good chunk of 4F and 5F moves after crouch RG. If this move itself gets Recoil Guarded, you should be careful when special cancelling this, but there are options. 623A and 214A are your fastest options, but any 236* move is an option as well, albeit slower."

Despite it being 11 frames startup, this move can be decent to throw out in Recoil Guard battles, but often times should be used as a last resort if no other normal can reach.

If any of the two snow bunnies hits the opponent, they will be put in a comboable frozen state. ※ Bunnies are active for 471.33 frames on every version, but their timer gets modified whenever a bunny makes contact with the opponent. The A version will drain 108.33 frames on bunny contact, the B version loses 50, and the C version restores 8.33 frames to the timer per bunny. Bunnies take 119.33 frames to respawn after contact. The first activation of this super always positions the bunnies in the same position. However, all subsequent supers will have the bunnies spawn where the previous one ended. Whether or not you use this super is preferential, but it does bolster Nayuki's pressure if utilized correctly. Some positives and negatives: + Makes 236A and 236C more dangerous mixup options as the opponent will be frozen after the low/overhead hits, allowing for the combo to continue without needing IC. 44 j412B can also be used to create a left/right situation with bunnies assuming they have good spawn points. + Limits the opponent's neutral options due to Nayuki's dash speed. + Leads to high damage combos, even from level 1. + Getting RFless conversions helps Nayuki build BIC during the super. + Can still build super meter while bunnies are active. - Bunnies offer no form of vertical protection, so you can still be anti-aired or hit by a low. - Expensive on upkeep, especially if used after 214214* super and usage of IC. - Gives the opponent another thing to Recoil Guard. Great for those with command throws. - Some character's wakeups are too fast to make proper utilization of the super. - If any of Nayuki's contact moves hit within the same frames of the bunnies hitting, the opponent will not freeze. - Throw actually becomes weaker during the super, as comboing into snowbunny freeze will actually let the opponent tech before Nayuki recovers. Snowbunnies can be setup safely after 2C. While it can be setup after 236C or 214214A, the opponent will often recover before you can use any meaningful setup against them. In order to safely setup after both of these moves, you need IC. Often times after 214214A or 214214B, the opponent will have a chance to recoil guard. The best thing for your opponent to do is to do nothing after the recoil guard (or use a command throw). Depending on the button, however, Snowbunnies could make it out on top if you respond properly. Common mixups from snowbunnies can range from the standard high/low from 236A or 236B to left/rights using airdash or backdash/backjump 412B. Throw is not recommended during snowbunnies, as the opponent can tech very early from the freeze and reset to neutral instead of being knocked down like normal. Conversions from snowbunnies can range from simple to complex. Ideally, you want to go into 236B refreeze loops to maximize damage. You could also run the opponent into the corner by pushing them there. Midscreen, you can use 66A 623A to combo into a refreeze. The snowbunnies will continue to rotate during hitstop and superflash. They will appear to be frozen until the freeze ends, and then teleport to their actual position."

Each clock begins its independent countdown after landing, but will soft-restart when hit. Each clock has a unique attack that it will perform after counting down. Very risky to go for due to the rather long startup, high meter cost and the fact that Nayuki will have to block a mixup after the invincible recovery. If you can safely get through that however, this move does have the potential to turn the pace around in your favor by creating a situation where the opponent can't reliably do combos while taking lots of chip damage and frame disadvantage. Nayuki has much better, reliable uses for meter so this Final Memory should generally be used when trying to surprise the opponent as it is very easy to beat before the superflash if they expect it. Nayuki is fully vulnerable until she throws the clocks, but the superflash is delayed so getting hit before then won't spend the meter."

Can be knocked around during this extra time. Upon landing from Nayuki's throw (not when hit by the opponent), this clock will start counting down immediately instead of waiting 60 frames for the first count, negating the extra cycle if it is not interrupted. This is the only clock to have hitstop, but it only affects itself and the opponent, not Nayuki, resulting in extreme frame advantage. This clock can absorb hits for Nayuki while it is counting down. This clock has a special, taller hurtbox."

Unlike other clocks, Keropii will not turn around when knocked into a corner, so which way it faces is determined by which way Nayuki was facing when throwing. For whatever reason, the left-facing Keropii will be knocked towards the opponent when hit instead of away."
