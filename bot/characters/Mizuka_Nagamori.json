            "Mizuka's Final Memory attack, one of the most unique in the game.",
            "Mizuka clutches her chest, keels over and screams as the screen fades to white.",
            "No matter where the opponent is on screen, they will be frozen in place and stunned.",
            "The opponent is stunned for 400 frames (nearly 7 seconds), giving Mizuka time to attack freely.",
            "When the stun period ends, the opponent is forcibly thrown into a knockdown state.",
            "During startup, the screen flashes white, and at frame 65.66, all notes detonate without disappearing.",
            "This move can penetrate through invincibility frames, making it one of few moves that can hit through reversals."
          ],
          "notes": "The slowest move in the game by far with its 140-frame startup, making it very difficult to use in most situations. Despite its power, there are almost no reliable setups for landing it, making it more of a hard read option than something to consistently incorporate into gameplay. However, when it does connect, it provides Mizuka with enough time to deal massive damage or set up an unblockable okizeme situation."
