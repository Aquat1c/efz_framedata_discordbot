      "mechanic": "Blood Level System: Ikumi has a unique blood gauge mechanic. Some of her moves will draw blood from the opponent when they hit, splattering it on the floor. As Ikumi picks up blood, her specials grow more powerful. Blood Level states are:\n• Blood Level 1 (0-2 filled bars): Meter is red. Most special moves are at base power.\n• Blood Level 2 (3-5 filled bars): Meter is orange. Special moves improve in various ways but start to cost blood.\n• Blood Level 3 (6-8 filled bars): Meter is yellow. Specials improve further but cost the same amount.\n• GENOCIDE MODE: When blood gauge is completely filled, Ikumi automatically enters Genocide Mode with enhanced normals, properties, and constant armor. This functions as a timer, and when empty, Ikumi returns to 0 blood level.",
